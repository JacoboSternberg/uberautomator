# Automater
Long distance travelling can be difficult when public transit stations are far from initial departure and final destination locations. Trip planning can also be a hassle when calling Ubers involves a wait, and when Internet/GPS connectivity may not be available at the time. Automater aims to solve both of these problems by planning an end-to-end route incorporating Uber with public transit, and by automating the process of hailing Ubers.
