# Hermes
One of the few issues with Uber is waiting for the driver to arrive at your location and long distance traveling. Hermes aims to solve both those problems.

# Here's how it works

#Step 1: 
Enter the time you expect to depart and departure location (If it's your current location, just press the dot on the right side of the search bar).

#Step 2: 
Enter your destination.

#Step 3: 
Receive a route of your travels, with instructions to either take Uber or public transportation.

#Step 4: 
Arrive at your destination!
